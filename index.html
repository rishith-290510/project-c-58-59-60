    <section>About Me

        <p> My interest is reading in my free time. Whenever i get free time i start reading a book which i enjoy.I am in class 5 and i like to read famous five and secret seven books. There are two types of books fiction and non-fiction. Fiction means something that is imaginary and non-fiction means a true real based story. I prefer reading fiction books cause they are very interesting.</p>

    <section>My Inspiration
    I want to become a writer like JK Rowling.
    <img src="JK%20Rowling.jpg">
    
1) There's More Harry Potter Material On the Way.
2) She's Generous. Rowling has donated ten million pounds to a research clinic at the University of Edinburgh. ...
3) She's In Touch With Her Fans. ...
4) She Wasn't a Remarkable Student. ...
5) Only One Harry Potter Character Is Completely Inspired By a Real Person.
